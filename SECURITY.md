Implementation Overview:
Restricted Files List: There is likely a predefined list of files and directories that are considered restricted. This list may include sensitive files (e.g., .htaccess, config.php) or directories that contain important system files.

File Access Check: Whenever a user attempts to access or modify a file, the system checks if that file is in the list of restricted files for the user's developer level.

Permission Denied: If the file is restricted and the user's developer level is not high enough, the system denies access or modification and returns an error message indicating insufficient permissions.

Example Scenario:
Let's say we have a file manager system where different users have different access levels. The system has a list of restricted files and directories, including .htaccess and the config directory.

Viewer (Level 1): Tries to access .htaccess. Access is denied because viewers cannot access restricted files.
Editor (Level 2): Tries to edit a file in the config directory. Access is denied because editors cannot modify files in restricted directories.
Administrator (Level 5): Can access and modify any file or directory, including restricted ones.
Security Benefits:
Protecting Sensitive Information: Restricting access to certain files and directories prevents unauthorized users from viewing or modifying sensitive information, such as database credentials or configuration settings.

Preventing Accidental Changes: Users with lower access levels are prevented from accidentally modifying critical files or directories that could disrupt the system's functionality.

Enhancing System Integrity: By ensuring that only authorized users can access or modify certain files, the system's overall security and integrity are improved.

Implementation Considerations:
Regular Updates: The list of restricted files and directories should be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect any changes in the system's architecture or security requirements.

Dynamic Permissions: In some cases, permissions may need to be dynamically assigned based on user roles or specific file requirements, rather than relying solely on static lists.

Logging and Monitoring: Logging access attempts to restricted files and directories can help identify potential security threats or unauthorized access attempts.
